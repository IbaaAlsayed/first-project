                C and C++ (also known as C plus plus or Cpp) are two of the oldest surviving programming languages. C++
                is directly derived from C, but flaunts more efficiency and productivity. Of course, both programming
                languages have advantages and drawbacks.

                To provide you with an overview of C vs C++, C++ is an enhanced version of the C programming language
                with the additional feature of being object-oriented. C has been the motivation behind the birth of not
                only C++ but a multitude of presently popular high-level programming languages, the likes of Java, PHP,
                and Python.

           <p>Let’s dive into the main difference between C and Cpp.</p>

              <h3> What is the Difference between C and C++?</h3> 
              <p>Before going in-depth into the difference between C and C plus plus, let’s first briefly look at both
                languages. The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ is a younger, more abstract language.

                C and C++ are both general-purpose languages with a solid community.
                C is a lightweight procedural language without a lot of abstraction.
                C++ is an object-oriented language that provides more abstraction and higher-level features.
                You can use both languages for just about anything — but C++ is generally considered more modernized.></p>

                <h3>What is C?</h3>
                <p>Popularly known as the Father of Modern Programming, C made its first appearance in 1972. It was
                developed by Dennis Ritchie while working at Bells Labs. Though originally created for making utilities
                capable of running on the Unix platform, it is now one of the world’s most widely used programming
                languages.</p>
                <p>
                    C is a procedural programming language that works on the lowest level of abstraction, making it a systems programming language. It is compiled, lightweight, and offers manual memory management.

The strength of the C programming language lies in performance. Programmers and developers can use C to code on various platforms. Bottom line? You can use C to code almost anything.

These days, we have more specialized and varied programming languages to pick from; however, C’s level of versatility was unmatchable during its younger years.
