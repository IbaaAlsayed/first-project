            Technically, however, React is a JS library developed for building UIs and components of the same. Then why is it listed among the best JS frameworks? Because it is capable of fulfilling several purposes of a typical JavaScript framework. React is so popular since it competes for head-on with Angular, a full-fledged and leading JS framework.

            Still, React, like any other JS framework, is JavaScript. So, you can learn to React with books, online tutorials, webinars, courses, etcetera. Next or side-by-side, you can work on React projects to assess what you’ve gained so far. Therefore, you can also leverage React projects to learn and assess your ability in it simultaneously.
            
            No matter your end goal(s) with React, here are the top 10 React projects that will help you realize it or advance one step closer to it.

        <h3>  Difference Between React and React Native</h3>   
        <p>Before you take a look at our pick of the 10 best React projects, we think it’s crucial to give you a brief overview of the difference between React and React Native.
            Many new individuals - and sometimes, even those who have already invested/devoted some time to web & app development - are unaware of the things that make React and React Native dissimilar. As a result, they get confused between both technologies.

While React is meant for developing the front end of web apps, React Native facilitates developing native apps for mobile platforms. Here are some of the key differences that will help you understand how React is different from React Native and vice-versa:
<ul>
    <li>React is a JavaScript library that allows you to design the front-end or UI components of single-page applications. On the other hand, React Native is a mobile application framework that supports the development of native apps.
</li>
    <li>React makes use of HTML tags and relies on a Javascript library and CSS for enabling animations, whereas React Native does not use HTML tags and comes with built-in animation libraries.
</li>
</ul>

           <h3> Best React Projects
        </h3> 
        <h3> 1.Real-Time Chat App
            </h3>
           <p>Expected Time to Complete - 1 hour to 1 day
            Level - Beginner
            Objective(s)
            
            To build a basic Chat app that can send messages in real-time.
            To use a chat API for handling the back-end of the app. </p>
             <hr>
             <h4>Project Overview</h4>
             <p>If you want to get started with React, developing a simple messaging app can be a good starting point, especially if you want to keep things easy and simple. You can develop a bare-bones real-time chat app in 1 hour or take more time to add more functionality to it, such as user authentication.

                With React, you will be able to create a simple yet attractive UI for your chat app. The messaging app should allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.
                
                As you might want to focus on your messaging app's front-end development with React, it’s good to use a chat API like SendBird or MirrorFly. The chat API will handle your app's back-end, and you do not need to engage yourself in writing server-side code. </p>

             <h3>2.Basic Calculator
               </h3>
             <p>
                Expected Time to Complete - 30 minutes to 1 day
                Level - Beginner
                Objective(s)
                
                To build a simple calculator application that supports basic arithmetic operations.  
             </p>

A virtual calculator built with React is another good project idea for you to try as a beginner. It’s quite easy to create a basic calculator with mathematical functions limited to addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Plus, how isn’t it good to develop a calculator on your own? For personal use.
However, you can transform your calculator app from simple to advanced by adding more complex features, such as the ones available in a typical scientific calculator.

Building a calculator might be simple, but being new to React, you will learn a lot as you will be building different components, rendering data based on user inputs, and debugging app code. You can get all sorts of creative with it if you wish to be. We would love to know about the same in the comments down below!
