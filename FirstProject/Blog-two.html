                Data science is a vast field that combines domain expertise, programming, statistics, and mathematics knowledge to create something meaningful. It is used by businesses in many different ways, and there's a massive demand for data scientists. 

                Python is a leading language that is used in Data Science, and many Python developers are switching to the Data Science domain by learning some fundamental concepts of data science. Whether you are already a data scientist or you are looking to make a switch to data science by leveraging your python skills, you'll need to have a good grip on five different concepts. 
                
                Once you've mastered these five concepts, you can excel at data science jobs and be an outstanding data scientist. 
                
                But before we explore those five concepts, it is essential to understand where and why businesses leverage data science in their processes.

           <h3>  Where and Why Do Businesses Use Data Science?</h3>   
           <p>Data science is magic for companies that know how to use it. There are many different applications of data science but most companies use data science for the below-stated use cases.</p>

              <h3> Improving Products and Services</h3> 
              <p>Data science allows companies to understand their products and services better. It can be used to analyze and create models that understand user reviews so that insight can be taken from them for improvement. 

                Data science helps businesses to run A/B testing experiments on a wider audience base and interpret the results. These experiments can be run indefinitely, and companies can find out areas where they can improve their products and services. </p>

                <h3>Mitigate Risks</h3>
                <p>Data science helps businesses predict their revenues, sales, and other vital factors. Using those predictions, companies can make better decisions that minimize their risks. It can also help to simulate risk situations so that management can keep practicing their risk-averting capabilities. Such simulations enable companies to find flaws in their risk-mitigating policies and come up with more potent and robust policies. </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Providing Better User Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Providing a better user experience is quite essential to retain customers and growing your business as 33% of users are ready to change companies just after their first bad experience. Without good research, there is significantly less chance that you can improve user experience. This is where data science helps companies. It allows them to experiment with different things and collect metrics on them so that they can be analyzed later to make product decisions. 

                    Iterating this every now and then helps companies to polish their productâ€™s user experience.
